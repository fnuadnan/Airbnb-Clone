## Introduction

You'll be working with the Airbnb development team to prototype a new and improved search and filter experience. Other developers on the team have written code that will add search results to the webpage. Your task is to make sure the *correct search results* are being added to the page based on the search term and filtering options. 

The final user experience should function [like this](https://i.imgur.com/xewHeDQ.mp4).

## Starter Code

There is existing code in `provided.js` that will implement the search feature and show results to the user. This code is wired to call the three functions included in `script.js`. The functions you complete in `script.js` will filter the search results based on the user's query and filtering options.

Note that you are writing a small bit of code that fits into a larger whole. This is oftentimes how the real world works. You won't always be familiar with the majority of code in a large project. The key is to understand how your piece fits in.  

> **ðŸ—’ Note:** The only file you'll need to edit to complete these tasks is `script.js`.

## Deliverable

Below are the two filtering functions you'll need to complete, as well as a Level Up you can try (number three)!

### 1. **`filterByCity(targetCity, listingCityArray)`**

| Parameter | Type | Example Argument |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `targetCity` | String | `"San Diego"` |
| `listingCityArray` | Array | `["Lake Tahoe", "San Diego", "Chicago"]` |

This function should return an array with each index from `listingCityArray` where the city matches `targetCity` **ignoring capitalization/case**.

### 2. **`filterByPrice(minPrice, maxPrice, listingPriceArray)`**
   
| Parameter | Type | Example Argument |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `minPrice` | Number | `100` |
| `maxPrice` | Number | `300` |
| `listingPriceArray` | Array | `[132, 430, 73, 198]` |

This function should return an array with each index from `listingPriceArray` where the price is between the minimum and maximum price specified by the user. 


## LevelUp! (Extra Credit)
Feel like you want to keep going? Tackle the `filterByTypes` function to snag some extra credit:

### 3. **`filterByTypes(targetTypes, listingTypeArray)`**

| Parameter | Type | Example Argument |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `targetTypes` | Array | `["entire-place", "private-room"]` |
| `listingTypeArray` | Array | `["entire-place", "private-room", "shared-room"]` |

This function should return an array with each index from `listingTypeArray` where the type of listing matches *ANY* of the `targetTypes`.
